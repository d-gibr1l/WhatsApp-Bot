~ ───────────────────── ~

🔐 *These commands are completely hidden from the public menu and only accessible to the bot owner or moderators.*

1️⃣ *Stealth Revive & Save*
*Command:* \`.//\`
*Usage:* Reply to a View Once (or any message) with \`.//\` to silently save its media to your DM.
*Description:* WhatsApp never sends View Once media to the bot — it's pulled from your reply, so this only works as a reply.

2️⃣ *Status Saver & Forwarder*
*Command:* \`.status\`
*Usage:* \`.status @user\` to fetch recent statuses. \`.auto status @user\` to automate it.
*Description:* Fetches someone's statuses and saves them to your DM.

3️⃣ *Group Management*
*Command:* \`.groups\`
*Usage:* \`.groups\` in a DM.
*Description:* Lists all groups the bot is in and provides their ID numbers for remote management.

4️⃣ *Anti-Delete System*
*Command:* \`.antidelete\`
*Usage:* \`.antidelete <on/off> [numbers/all]\`
*Description:* Catches "Delete for Everyone" messages and broadcasts them back to the group or forwards them to your DM.
